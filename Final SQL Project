-- This is my final project from Chinook Dataset which represents a digital media store.
-- Please let me know if you have questions!


1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT Firstname, Lastname, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA'

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil
SELECT Firstname, Lastname, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.Firstname, cust.Lastname, inv.InvoiceID, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
where Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices;

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT inv.InvoiceId, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices Inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
SELECT t.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON inv.TrackId = t.TrackId

11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID
