-- This is my final project from Chinook Dataset which represents a digital media store.
-- Please let me know if you have questions!


1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT Firstname, Lastname, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA'

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT Firstname, Lastname, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
