-- This is my project on customers & orders answering business questions in SQLite Studio
-- I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1. How many odrder was placed in January? 9681
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 379
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'orderID'

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE (SELECT min(price)FROM BIT_DB.JanSales) 
ORDER BY price
Limit 1

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
--(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

-- 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

-- 9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) > 2

-- 10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphones%'
